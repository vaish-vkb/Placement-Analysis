Dlithe Internship
This internship has trained me different analytics learning library like numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn. We also had a few classes in machine learning and statistics which help us analyze the given data. 
The data used in this project is from Kaggle.

Instructions to go about the code:

-> This file contains ipynb file since the code was built on jupyter.

-> Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and Matplotlib are used for data analysis.

-> This project was built on python.

-> The dataset is sourced from Kaggle.

-> The questions asked regarding the data have been divided the same way in the code.

-> The ending results of all questions are based on graphs which are done using matplotlib.

-> In the end section of the report, answers based on results have been uploaded.

-> For any further doubts, you can check the report.
